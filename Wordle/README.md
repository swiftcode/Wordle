## Wordle

Swift version of Wordle written in UIKit.

## Data Source

For the beta version, the data is bundled in the app with a list of several thousand 5 letter words.  Later versions will use an API to get data from any one of several candidate word sources.  Ideally, an API that can return words with exactly the number of letters we want per word would be best.   

This list came from https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt 

## Features

The beta version is as close to the original as possible.  Some changes have been implemented, such as small differences in the UI.  

Future features will be changes in animation, difficulty levels and themes, to name a few.
